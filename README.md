# DiscordNotes

A very simple chrome extension for sending selected Text / images to a Discord channel per webhoook.

# Why

For learning to develop a simple chrome extension mostly. However, as a computer science student, I've got dozens of tabs when researching topics.
I didn't trust any other chrome extension which would help me, so I built my own. 
It helped that the scope wasn't big.

# Features

- send to Discord:
  - selected text
  - image

# Roadmap

- tagging system
